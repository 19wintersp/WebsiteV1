					<h1>About me</h1>
					<div>
						Hello! I'm a human who likes to tell computers what to do. My first "proper" programming language was Python, however I mostly use NodeJS, Web Technologies and C++ now. I'll also occasionally use Java and C#, though the the JVM and .NET Framework annoy me a little. I also want to use Deno, but Replit is being a bit annoying at the moment by using a version that's horribly out of date.<br/><br/>
						At the moment, I'm working on a few projects, which you can see more of in <i>Projects</i>. My main foci are a stock-trading simulation game, a music notation app, and a fully-featured voice- and text- chat application; all of which are built with Web Technologies.<br/><br/>

						Here's a list of some of the projects I've made or am making. You can see all of them on <a href="//repl.it/@19wintersp">my Replit profile</a>.

							<h2>Polyphony (Preview)</h2>
							<p><a href="https://polyphonypreview.19wintersp.repl.co/">Site</a> | <a href="//repl.it/@19wintersp/PolyphonyPreview">Code</a> | <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share/TESTING-Voice-and-Text-chat-with-WebSockets/79045">Post</a></p>
							Polyphony Preview is a site used to test technologies which will eventually become a part of Polyphony: my voice- and text- chat application which is essentially just a cheap knockoff of Discord. PolyphonyPreview lets you chat through messages and group calls, along with private, shareable rooms. Don't worry though, the finished version will look much better, have many more features, and actual accounts and permanent messages.

							<h2>ConnectFour Bot</h2>
							<p><a href="//repl.it/@19wintersp/ConnectFourBot">Code</a> | <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share/ConnectFour-with-difficult-AI/60977">Post</a></p>
							My ConnectFour bot was a test of C++, as it was one of the first relatively complex programs I made in it. The bot used "reality branches" to compute its best move, however it struggled on the speed side. I'm still trying to figure out how to use multithreading. I suggest that you fork this repl and fiddle around with some of the configuration, and see if you can tune-out some of the bugs it has.

							<h2>GameMaker GUI</h2>
							<p><a href="https://gamemakergui.19wintersp.repl.co/">Site</a> | <a href="//repl.it/@19wintersp/GameMakerGUI">Code</a> | <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share/pencil-Make-your-own-adventure-games/84512">Post</a></p>
							GameMaker GUI was the web version of my unsuccessful GameMaker; both of which were designed to make it easier to create choose-your-own-adventure-style games. They both make use of a system to serialize (non-binary) trees, albeit with one much less exciting than the other. It's a bit hard to use, and the <i>Help</i> function is a bit useless, but it does work relatively well. It was also the prototype of my "new" design language (which should probably be named "Bland and Ugly") which was influenced by Material Design and Google, though with some elements from Metro.

							<h2>XHTML Introduction*</h2>
							<p><a href="https://xhtml-intro.xxpertHacker.repl.co/">Site</a> | <a href="//repl.it/@xxpertHacker/XHTML-Intro">Code</a> | <a href="https://repl.it/talk/share/XHTML-Introduction/82997">Post</a></p>
							An Introduction to XHTML. Made by <a href="//repl.it/@xxpertHacker">@xxpertHacker</a>, this webpage introduces you to the magical world of XML being used to create webpages. I <i>strongly</i> suggest you have a look at it. I played a minor role in doing some CSS stuff and proofreading the draft a bit.
